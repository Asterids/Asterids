- ğŸ¤“ Always something new to learn
- ğŸŒ± Developer, maker, cat parent, plant parent, explorer, games enthusiast
- ğŸ¤– I have an Arduino that I can't for the life of me decide what to use for (suggestions welcome!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once partnered in starting up a storefront for locally-made goods in upstate NY
- ğŸ˜º Cats and trackpads do not mix
